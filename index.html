            <p style="text-align: left;">
                I am currenly pursuing a bachelors in electrical and computer engineering at <strong>Northeastern University</strong>.
                Outside of classes, I am involved in various organizations including <strong>Club, Forge, and BAJA SAE.</strong> 
                In robotics club, I am a part of the marine robotics project where I waterproof connections and test thrusters on our ROV in preparation for the national MATE competition.
                In Forge, I am currently serving as a hardware lead and was previously a member on the Back Buddy project.
                Lastly in BAJA SAE, I am a member of the sparky team where I work on our car's power system, model and CAD various car parts, and teach new members.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                I graduated from <strong>Northside High School</strong> in 2023 as an honor grad. 
                While there, I was involved with various clubs including <strong>DECA, FBLA, and Academic Bowl.</strong>
                My biggest accomplishments there were placing 5th place statewide in publication design for FBLA 2023,
                being awarded the Georgia Certificate of Merit, and serving as president for my school's FBLA chapter.

            <summary>Other Interests</summary>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Some hobbies of mine include running, weightlifting, cooking, drawing, and reading. One day I hope to be able to run a marathon
                and draw portraits of people. I am still a long way from doing either, but when I am down about it I have the other hobbies to boost me.
                On top of that, I am also trying to learn to speak Mandarin. I am currently at an HSK3 level and I hope to improve in the future.
